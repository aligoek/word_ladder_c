# Word Ladder 

A C program to find a word ladder (a sequence of words where each differs by one letter) between two given words using a breadth-first search approach.


This project implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between a starting and ending word by changing one letter at a time, using a provided dictionary file. It utilizes custom queue and stack data structures.
